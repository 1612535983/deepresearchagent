# Acknowledgments

DeepResearchAgent is an independent, learning-oriented engineering project.
Its project-specific state model, tools, middleware composition, P1/P4/P5
governance pipeline, and Markdown/BM25 memory implementation live in this
repository and are covered by its tests.

## Runtime foundations

  streaming, and checkpointing primitives (MIT License).

## Architecture references

The following public projects were studied to compare design choices rather
than treated as one-to-one source templates:

- [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) — long-horizon harness
  boundaries, context engineering, external working memory, and persistent
  memory as a runtime capability (MIT License).
- [Open Deep Research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) —
  plan-and-research workflows, report generation, and evaluation structure
  (MIT License).
- [Poirot](https://github.com/HezaoHezao/poirot) — one reference among several
  for middleware-oriented agent organization, context governance, and memory
  layering (MIT License).
